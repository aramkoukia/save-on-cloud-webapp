# Save On Cloud
Answer critical questions about the cost structure of your Cloud Infrastructure spending

## Features: How can Save On Cloud help? 
* Focus on the big costs - Show the most expensive service on a daily basis
* Focus on the spending trends - Show the fastest growing service from cost point of view in the last few days
* Focus on what's not used - Show top useless services that are paid for (Logs, API calls, Cert manager, etc)
* Real-time running cost and forecasting - Our real-time running cost feature allows you to know your Cloud spend in real-time long before you are surprised with a huge bill.
* Cloud Spend Alert and Notification - You will get notified if your Cloud services started to spend a lot of money, so you can stop them before it is too late.
